# MEOWI: Monitoring & Evaluation for Optimization of Water Infrastructure

**A False Positive project**

---

## Problem

Bulgaria has over **4,000 reservoirs**, but water scarcity is still a major issue. The country's water network is **four times larger than all its roads**, yet many communities face water shortages because:

- The infrastructure is old and inefficient.
- **More than half** of the water is lost before reaching homes.
- There is no easy way for citizens to find out about water losses, supply status, or future trends.

The core issue is **poor water management**, not a lack of resources. In fact, Bulgaria has **four times more water resources** than it needs, but inefficient distribution and outdated systems lead to significant wastage.

## Solution

**MEOWI** is a centralized platform that:

- Collects data from official sources and user reports.
- Displays interactive maps showing where water comes from and how much is lost.
- Analyzes consumption trends and predicts future changes.
- Allows users to report water supply issues easily.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Raises awareness** about water wastage.
- **Empowers citizens and institutions** to make informed decisions.
- **Promotes sustainable water management** and helps optimize resource usage.

---

## Our Goal

To provide **clear and accessible information** about water resources, helping people understand where their water goes and how to use it more efficiently.

---

## Technical Architecture

MEOWI is built using modern technologies and a microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, featuring a responsive UI built with TailwindCSS and Radix UI components
- **Backend Services**: Multiple Python microservices handling different aspects:
  - Data collection and scraping services
  - FastAPI-based REST APIs
  - Tile server for map data
  - Forecasting service for predictive analytics
- **Maps Integration**: Using Leaflet and Google Maps APIs for interactive visualization
- **Modern Development**: Utilizing TypeScript for type safety, ESLint for code quality, and containerized services for deployment
